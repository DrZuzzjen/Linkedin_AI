15 Engaging LinkedIn Post Examples
Let’s look at some of the best LinkedIn post examples that will help you generate interest, attract readers, and get engagement.
1. An Inspiring Story
How did you get where you are now?
Everyone loves a good story. Especially when it’s a relatable and motivating story about how someone turned their failures into success, build trust with your audience by sharing an honest story about the challenges or skepticism you encountered.
Don’t focus too much on yourself and provide value to your network members. Describe the turning point and highlight the implemented strategies.
2. A Quote From a Thought Leader
In any industry, some people stand out as thought leaders.
Inspire your audience and demonstrate your engagement with the industry by sharing their wisdom. 
To enrich the message, provide context, add your thoughts, and highlight the insight’s practical application.
3. Product or Service Update
Are you launching a new product or a big update on your product or service? Keep your followers informed with a LinkedIn post that shares any updates or new features for your company's product. 
Turn followers into customers and get high-quality leads with a LinkedIn post highlighting your product or service's best features and benefits.
Encourage your followers to engage with your post so you can reach more people who fit your business's buyer persona.

5. A Lesson Learned
When you share personal experiences, your followers think of you as genuine and reliable, which makes them engage with you on a personal level. 
However, not every personal lesson may be relevant to your audience. Share a story with a clear message that resonates with your audience. Pick a topic related to your industry and highlight its practical application.
6. Customer Testimonials
Writing a LinkedIn post featuring customer feedback is a great way to build credibility and engage with your network. Select a piece of feedback that highlights your product’s value and impact. You can quote the feedback or share it as a summarized version. If you plan on tagging the customer, ask for their consent.

Highlight the key efforts that contributed to this accomplishment. Express gratitude to people who helped you, such as colleagues, mentors, or family members. Use a professional tone, but let your genuine excitement and pride shine.
Make the post more engaging by incorporating visuals such as a relevant picture or certificate.
8. A Joke
The easiest way to break the ice with your audience? A well-placed joke. 
Boost your engagement and get more comments, likes, and shares by making your network laugh.
Remember, the key is choosing humor appropriate for your audience and brand. Avoid anything offensive or too personal.
9. An Event
Showcase your business expertise and strategically engage with your network with a LinkedIn post that announces a company event, such as a webinar or Ask Me Anything (AMA) session.
Build interest and credibility among your LinkedIn network by focusing on the speakers’ credentials and expertise. 
Ensure your LinkedIn network is well-prepared by providing essential details, including the date, time, and platform, and explaining what attendees can expect to learn or gain by participating.
10. Share a Job Opening
Sharing a job opportunity on your business LinkedIn page is an efficient way to leverage your professional network and attract top talent. Encourage candidates to apply or ask your followers to recommend other LinkedIn members who might be a good fit.

End the LinkedIn post with a call to action, asking your network to participate and tag colleagues who might be interested.
The most important thing when doing a LinkedIn contest? Make sure the prize is worth your followers’ time and energy.

Get more engagement by inviting your audience to read the full feature, share their thoughts, or tag others who might be interested.
Besides getting more LinkedIn visibility, sharing content that mentions your brand builds credibility and trust among your LinkedIn audience.
What Not to Post on LinkedIn
Now that you know what to post on LinkedIn, let’s discuss what you shouldn’t post.
Do not spam. Your audience will recognize spamming and not engage with your posts if you continue to spam them.
Do not post salesy posts or over-promote your products or services. This will likely put off your audience.
Avoid controversial topics that may hurt people’s sentiments.
Double-check the information you are sharing. You do not want to knowingly or unknowingly share the wrong information.
How to Make Your LinkedIn Posts Stand Out
With thousands of posts shared on LinkedIn daily, how do you make your posts stand out and get noticed? If you want to get more followers and generate leads from LinkedIn, your content needs to be captivating. Here are a few tips to consider:
Create an intriguing, clear, and simple headline that sparks interest in your users. This will grab the readers' attention and encourage them to read the entire post.
Create posts that start conversations. Ask questions and encourage your audience to share their opinions.
Tell your personal story. People like knowing that there’s a human side to your brand.
Use quality images and videos. Visuals grab the attention of LinkedIn users and increase engagement.
Lower your post’s reading level. Use simple words and avoid jargon. Keep it simple, easy to digest, and deliver complex information in bite-sized doses.
Take care of formatting. Bold, italic text style matters! Use Taplio’s Post Formatter to simplify this task.
